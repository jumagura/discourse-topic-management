# Discourse Topic Management Plugin

The **Discourse Topic Management Plugin** provides enhanced functionality for managing topics in Discourse. It allows forum admins and moderators to move topics to a hidden category and set limits on the number of replies for topics in certain categories or tagged with specific hashtags. This ensures a controlled environment for contests, promotions, or other events where only a limited number of users can contribute.

## Features

1. **Topic Deletion to Hidden Category**:

   - Allows users (topic owners) to move their topics to a designated hidden category instead of deletion.
   - **Only staff** can see and access the hidden category. The topic owner and regular users cannot access or retrieve topics moved to this category.

2. **Reply Limit on Topics**:
   - Admins can set a reply limit for topics based on the category or hashtag (e.g., SummerFunContest).
   - Once the limit is reached, only the original poster, staff, moderators, and existing repliers can continue to reply.
   - New users who haven't replied yet will have the reply button hidden and will see a message indicating the reply limit has been reached.
